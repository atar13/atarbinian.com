<!-- Intro -->
I'm a master's student in Computer Science at UC San Diego advised by [Professor Pat Pannuto](https://patpannuto.com/). My interests lie in building secure and reliable computer systems. I also am passionate about designing long-lasting and sustainable electronics. 

<!-- Tock -->
I primarily work on the [Tock Operating System](https://tockos.org/), an embedded operating system designed with security at the forefront. I'm currently working on adding shared libraries for userspace applications. I've also worked on adding process isolation to the nonvolatile storage driver as well as helping to port the OpenThread networking stack to Tock. 

I've had the privilege of TAing for [Professor Pat Pannuto's](https://patpannuto.com/) [Wireless Networks (CSE 122/222C WI25)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/wi25/cse222C-a/labs.html) and [Professor Geoffrey Voelker's](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~voelker/) [Operating Systems (CSE 120 FA24)](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/classes/fa24/cse120-a/).

<!-- work -->
Previously, I interned at [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) for Summer 2022 and 2023 where I built security-oriented software in [Go](https://go.dev/). Before that, I interned at [ETA Compute](https://etacompute.com/) where I tested their compiler for quantized deep learning  models.

<!-- tuas + frc -->
During my undergrad, I was one of two leads of the software team on [Triton UAS](https://tritonuas.com/), an undergraduate organization which builds, programs and flies it's own autonomous plane for a yearly competiton. We received 5th place in 2022! In high school, I had a great time on FRC ([Team 696](http://www.team696.org/)).

<!-- Nix -->
In pursuit of reliable software, I use the NixOS Linux distribution on my laptop and home server. I believe that Nix can reduce many of the headaches that come with maintaining a Linux machine over a long period of time. You can check out a [talk I gave at NixCon NA 24/SCALE21X](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8oyoDMUM2I) with [Samir Rashid](https://godsped.com) that outlines the benefits of using Nix to manage a home server.

<!-- Transit -->
I'm a staunch advocate for human-centric cities that give people the freedom to choose how they get around. I think we can start by designing our cities to be accessible across all modes of transportation.
