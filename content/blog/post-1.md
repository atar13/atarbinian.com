This is the first post of (hopefully) many on my blog. Time will tell if this ends up being the only post ...

I don't have a well-defined plan for this blog besides for a few ideas that have been floating in my head for the past year or so. I plan to cover:
- technologies I'm interested in
- how-to guides
- right to repair
- privacy and open source
- urban planning 
- anything else that comes to mind

If any of that sounds interesting, add this feed to your favorite RSS reader and stay tuned!
